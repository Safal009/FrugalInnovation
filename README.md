# Edible Paper Wrap: Sustainable Approach

## Project Overview

The Edible Paper Wrap project addresses the hygiene and messiness concerns associated with traditional packaging for frankies. By introducing an edible, biodegradable alternative, we aim to enhance the eating experience while promoting sustainability and reducing waste.

## Problem Statement

Frankies, a popular street food, are often consumed with traditional paper wraps that can be flimsy and lead to a messy eating experience. Consumers have raised concerns about hygiene and convenience, with many finding the current packaging inadequate. This project seeks to develop an innovative packaging solution that mitigates these issues.

## Solution: Edible Paper Wrap

Our proposed solution is an edible paper wrap made from natural ingredients that can be consumed along with the frankie. This wrap offers several advantages:

- **Hygienic**: Reduces the risk of contamination by eliminating the need for non-biodegradable wrappers.
- **Convenient**: Provides a cleaner eating experience as it holds the frankie securely without falling apart.
- **Sustainable**: Made from biodegradable materials, it contributes to environmental conservation by reducing plastic waste.

## Business Model

To encourage adoption of the edible paper wrap, we propose the following business model:

1. **Free Packaging for Businesses**: We will provide the edible paper wrap packaging to frankie vendors and businesses at no cost. This eliminates the barrier of entry for vendors, making it easier for them to switch to a sustainable option.

2. **Partnerships with Vendors**: We will establish partnerships with local frankie vendors to promote the use of our edible wraps. Vendors can advertise the sustainable aspect of their products, attracting environmentally-conscious customers.

3. **Revenue Generation through Volume**: Our revenue model will be based on the volume of frankies sold using our edible wraps. We will charge vendors a nominal fee based on the number of wraps used, ensuring that they benefit from increased sales while we maintain a sustainable profit margin.

4. **Branding and Marketing**: We will leverage the eco-friendly nature of our product to create a strong brand identity. Marketing efforts will focus on the benefits of using edible wraps, including hygiene, sustainability, and improved customer experience.

## Ingredients and Production

The edible paper wrap will be made from natural, food-safe ingredients, such as:

- Wheat flour
- Tapioca starch
- Natural flavorings
- Food-grade colorings

The production process will ensure that the wraps are durable enough to hold the frankie while being safe for consumption.

## Target Market

Our primary target market includes:

- **Street food vendors**: Frankies and other similar food items.
- **Restaurants and cafes**: Establishments looking for innovative, sustainable packaging solutions.

## Conclusion

The Edible Paper Wrap project represents a significant step toward sustainable innovation in food packaging. By addressing the hygiene concerns of traditional wraps and providing a free, eco-friendly solution to vendors, we can enhance the consumer experience while contributing to a more sustainable future.

## Next Steps

- Finalize the recipe for the edible paper wrap.
